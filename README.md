<h1>My first real script made for ubuntu have been posted</h1>
<p>Included in this repo is one that just installs firefox as a deb nota snap from the ppa:mozillateam/ppa repo.
Warning this repo is not offical but was the only real way to include firefox on my install as a deb not a snap so I use this. Use at own risk.</p>
<p>Included in these are installing discord, spotify, steam, automatically when autoreinstall.sh is ran.</p>
<p>Included in installfirefoxdeb.sh is the auto installing of firefox deb version from ppa:mozillateam/ppa.</p>
